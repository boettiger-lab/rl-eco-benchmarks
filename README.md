## Benchmarking RL on ecological problems

This package will provide a procedure to easily test RL algorithms on a series of benchmarks inspired by ecological adaptive management problems.
`base_env` provides a flexible API for generating Gym environments based on such problems. Its use is exemplified on the `envs/script_example.py` script.
